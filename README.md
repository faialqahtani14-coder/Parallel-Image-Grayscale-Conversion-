# Parallel-Image-Grayscale-Conversion-
 we offer Parallel Image Grayscale Conversion, which uses data  parallelism to speed up the grayscale converting process. The objective is to  emphasize the function of parallelization in contemporary image processing systems and show how it dramatically boosts performance when compared to  sequential execution
